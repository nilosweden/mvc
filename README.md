# mvc
Simple MVC Framework for PHP

This includes a small sql-wrapper around PDO.

##Use
When creating a new controller, the name of the controller will be the route/url. The framework will make sure that the correct number of parameters are passed to the function, it also takes into account the type hinting for arrays.

You can also pass long json which automatically will be converted to a PHP array.

##Alpha
This project is in alpha and a more detailed description will be added soon.
